**This is a copy of EvoMaster Benchmark v4.0.0 for evaluating CoAster.**

# Build

First, you need to set necessary environment variables, e.g.,
```
export JAVA_HOME_8=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/
export JAVA_HOME_11=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
export JAVA_HOME_17=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/
export JAVA_HOME_21=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/
```

Then, run the script to build the benchmark. This script will skip all tests.
```
python ./scripts/dist.py
```

# Run EvoMaster-Generated Tests and their Split Test Classes

For each application, their EvoMaster-generated test class is placed under the same module of their external EvoMaster driver, usually `<jdk_?_maven>/em/external/rest/<app-name>/test/`.

For example, the test classes for restcountries are under
```
jdk_8_maven/em/external/rest/restcountries/src/test
```

Inside this folder, `single_class` contains the sinlge JUnit 5 class generated by EvoMaster, and `split_classes` contains the split test classes, each of which has only one test method.

The general command to run all JUnit tests in Maven is (under the same directory of the pom)
```
mvn test
```

To run a single test class:
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=<test class name>
# e.g.
mvn test -Dtest=EM_restcountriesdefault_1234_Test
```

To run a single test method:
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=<test class name>#<test method name>
# e.g.
mvn test -Dtest=EM_restcountriesdefault_1234_Test#test_0_getOnOpenapi_yamlReturnsContent
```

To run all tests in a package:
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=<some package>.**
# e.g.
mvn test -Dtest=em.emtests.split_classes.**
```
